When I need to import data that are not on my computer, unless I will use the same data more than twice, I would rather not to save the file on my disk and use R function to download.

```R
library(RCurl)
dt <- getURLContent(URLencode("https://topepo.github.io/caret/descr.RData"))
```

`getURL` may issue an error when the file is not text. `getURLContent` will determine the type of the content automatically.

`URLencode` is to encode the link. In this case, it is unnecessary, but for link contains quotes, we have to use 'URLencode' to process the link at first.
