**Question**:

A rope is divided randomly into three pieces. Find the average length of the shortest/longest segment.

**Answer**:

The shortest one is $$\frac{1}{9}$$, the longest one is $$\frac{11}{18}$$.

More generally, if the stick is broken into $$n$$ pieces, then the shortest one is $$\frac{1}{n^2}$$ and the longest one is $$\frac{1}{n}H_n$$, where $$H_n$$ is the [harmonic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_number).
